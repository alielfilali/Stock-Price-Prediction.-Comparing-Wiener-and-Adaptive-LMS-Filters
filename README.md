Forecasting future values of time series is a critical challenge in fields such as finance, control systems, and signal processing. Filters like the Wiener filter and LMS adaptive filters are extensively used due to their mathematical rigor and effectiveness in handling noisy data. This assignment will guide students through the implementation of these filters and the evaluation of their performance using real-world stock market data.

Analyze real-world financial data:
Work with data retrieved from Yahoo Finance for a selected stock (e.g., Apple, Microsoft). For this assignment, the dataset focuses on Apple Inc. (AAPL), traded on the NASDAQ market.
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine stock price trends, identify noise patterns, and assess market volatility.
Implement predictive filters: * Wiener filter: A fixed-parameter filter that leverages past autocorrelation of the data to compute an optimal prediction under stationary conditions. * LMS adaptive filter: A dynamic filter that continuously adjusts its parameters to adapt to changing trends and noise levels, making it suitable for non-stationary data.
Tune parameters:

Experiment with key filter parameters, such as the order size for the Wiener filter and the learning rate for the LMS filter, to evaluate their impact on the prediction accuracy and adaptability to the data.
Compare filters:

Visualize the predictions generated by each filter and compute error metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error) to assess their performance and determine which filter is more effective under various conditions.
